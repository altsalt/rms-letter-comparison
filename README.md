# GitHub Petitions Regarding Removal of RMS: Contributor Comparison

On March 22, 2021 the former president of the Free Software Foundation (FSF) Richard M. Stallman (rms) announced that he would be returning to the FSF board.\footnote{\url{https://twitter.com/nixcraft/status/1373905399707955202}} This comes 18 months after he stepped down, due to public pressure regarding, among other things, statements relating to the involvement of Marvin Minsky and Jeffrey Epstein.\footnote{\url{https://itsfoss.com/richard-stallman-controversy}}

On March 23, 2021 a letter was published online calling for the removal of rms from all leadership positions within the Free/Libre/Open Source Software community.\footnote{\url{https://rms-open-letter.github.io/}} Shortly thereafter, a counter letter, in support of the return of rms was published.\footnote{\url{https://rms-support-letter.github.io/}}

Each of these letters called for readers to add their signatures via a pull request (PR) using GitHub, one of the largest hosts for FLOSS projects. As of 10:00:00 UTC on March 25, 2021, the letter requesting removal has received over 2,000 signatures, while the letter in support of remaining has received just over 1,400.

Below is a cursory analysis comparing contributors to each letter.
